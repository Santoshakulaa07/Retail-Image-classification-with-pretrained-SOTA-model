AIM : To create a computer vision (multi class) Image classification project on Image classification of Retail Products. 
Image Classification (often referred to as Image Recognition) is the task of associating one (single-label classification) or more (multi-label classification) labels to a given image.	

Objectives : To create a classification model to Predict the 25 types of Retail products and to find the accuracy of those Prediction


Preprocessing : The images are unzipped and  placed into their respective locations. All the images are scaled evenly to specific aspect ratio and augmentation techniques using 
ImageDataGenerator is used like centering, normalization, rotation, zoom and shifting is done. Once done, the sample images are viewed to ensure uniformity
